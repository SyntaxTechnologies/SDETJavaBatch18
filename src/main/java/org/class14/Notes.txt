Types Of variables:
    There are three types of variables in java
    with respect to scope/visibility/accessibility
    1) local 2) instance 3) static.
Local Variable:
    Local variables are the variables which are defined inside
    the block of code like if-else statement,loop,switch-statement
    methods. They can only be accessed with-in that block of code.
UpSide:
    They occupy the memory for least amount of time inside your computer.
    You should always try to go with local variables.
DownSide:
    They can only be accessed with-in the same block where they are created.

Instance Variables:
    The variables which are defined inside a class but outside a block of code
    like method,if-else statement,loop,switch etc., are called as instance variables.
    They can be accessed anywhere in the class except static methods.
Upside:
    They can be accessed anywhere inside a class other than static methods.
DownSide:
    They occupy the memory for longer as compared to a local variable.
