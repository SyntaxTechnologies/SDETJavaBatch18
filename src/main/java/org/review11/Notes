Collections Framework:
    Collections framework is simply a collection of classes and interfaces.
    which help us store the data easily. The classes in this framework are
    dynamic and have a lot of built-in methods that we can use to manipulate
    the data.
Main Interfaces
1)List 2) Set 3) Map
    List:
    1) List can store duplicate numbers.
    2) The remember the order in which you insert the data.
    There are two main classes which implement the list interface
    ArrayList and LinkedList.
    ArrayList internally uses an array. Which makes accessing the elements
    Fast but adding or removing the elements is super slow in arrayList.
    On the other hand LinkedList uses a double linkedList internally.
Sets:
    Sets don't allow duplicate elements.
    There are three main types of sets.
    1)HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet.
1)HashSet:
    Pros:
        Hashset is Fast.
    Cons:
        They don't remember the order in which we insert the elements.
2) LinkedHashSet:
    Pros:
        They remember the order.
    Cons:
        A little slow as compared to Hashset.
3) TreeSet:
    Pros:
        They always keep the data sorted.
    Cons:
    The insertion is very slow.
Maps:
    Maps Allow us to store the data in pairs(key,value).
    There are three Main types of Maps.
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
1)HashMap:
    Pros:
        Hashset is Fast.
    Cons:
        They don't remember the order in which we insert the elements.
2) LinkedHashMap:
    Pros:
        They remember the order.
    Cons:
        A little slow as compared to HashMap.
3) TreeMap:
    Pros:
        They always keep the data sorted.
    Cons:
    The insertion is very slow.
File Handling:
    Dealing with files reading/writing/copying/moving files using programming.
    1) Location of the file
    2) Navigate to the location/bring the file to the RAM.
    3) A software/class that knows how to read/write data to that file.
 Configuration files:
    Configuration files are used to store sensitive configuration related information. Like URLS,
    usernames, passwords etc.
