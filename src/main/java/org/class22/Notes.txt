Interface:
    Interfaces are contracts. They are used to make sure that every
    programmer is on the same page. The use abstraction for this
    purpose.
Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation says create a class for every entity and define
    methods related to that entity in that class instead of putting
    everything inside the main method. It also says make your
    fields private and define getter setter methods for those
    fields.
