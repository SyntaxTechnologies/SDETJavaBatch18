LinkedList:

Set:
    Sets are very similar to list but they do not
    allow duplicate elements.
HashSet:
    UpSide:
    Its Fast.
    DownSide:
    They don't store the data in order.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside:
        It remembers the order.
    Downside:
        Its slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
    Upside:
        It keeps the data sorted always.
    Downside:
           Inserting new elements is very slow.
