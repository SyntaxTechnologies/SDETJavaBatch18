Why are we here?
    We are here to be automation engineer.
what do Automation engineers do?
    They write code which test software applications like
    Amazon.com facebook.com etc. To save time.
To Automate the testing what do we need?
    WE need to write instructions in a language that computer can
    understand. Such as Java.
 How we can learn java effectively?
    Practice Practice Practice.
Variables:
    Variables are containers that we use to store information.
    There are 8 basic types of variables which are called
    primitives.

    byte
    short
    int (Most widely used type)
    long

    float
    double(Most widely used type)
    char
    boolean(Heavily used to write logic)
    We have non-primitive data type String.

Arithmetic Operators(+-*/%):
    These are symbols in java that we use to perform addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus.
ShortHandOperators:
    These are same above operators but are a shorter way of doing
    above calculations
    += -+ *= /= %=
