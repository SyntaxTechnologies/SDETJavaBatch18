PolyMorphism:
    It's a mechanism in java that allows the methods
    to behave differently depending upon which object
    are using to call them. There are two types of
    polymorphism dynamic and static.
    Dynamic PolyMorphism is achieved through method overriding.
    static PolyMorphism is achieved through method overloading.
Why should we use PolyMorphism:
    It allows us to avoid code repetition. If we have to call
    multiple methods from multiple classes, and they are all sibling classes.

 What do we need to apply PolyMorphism.
    1)Inheritance.
    2)Method overriding.
    3)Type casting.
    4)Loops.
    5)Arrays.

Interface:
    Interfaces are like contracts which makes sure that everybody is on
    the same page. They achieve this through abstraction.
