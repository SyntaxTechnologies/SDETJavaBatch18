Abstraction in Java:
    Abstract means something which is not clear
    or not complete. We use abstraction to create
    methods which are incomplete meaning they don't
    have a body. they only have method headers.
Why Should we create abstract methods?
    1) When we know that every child will be overriding
    a method we don't need to have a method body.
    2) It acts as a template when we create a method as
    abstract every child must provide body for that.
    It is used to enforce methods on the child classes.
