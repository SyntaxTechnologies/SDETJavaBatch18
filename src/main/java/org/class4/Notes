Nested If Else condition:
    Nested if conditions one condition inside another one.
Why we need it?
    In real life many decisions are dependent on each other.
    if outer condition is not met it does not make sense to
    proceed with in the inner conditions.
    For example before we can place an order on a website
    we first want to make sure
    1)User is logged-in
    2) User has selected some products
    3) Products are available in inventory
    4) User selects a valid payment method
    5) User has enough balance.
    6) If all above conditions are met then only we want to
    place an order.
