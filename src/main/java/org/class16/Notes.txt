Inheritance:
     Inheritance allows us to build classes from
     existing classes. We can inherit fields and methods
     from existing classes if we need them in other classes.
     There are 5 major types of inheritance.
     1) Single Inheritance.
     2) Hierarchical Inheritance.
     3) Multilevel Inheritance.
