Methods:
    A block of code that preforms a specific action
    when called. In Java methods can only exit inside a
    class. If the method is instance method we need to create
    the object of the class to call if method is static we
    use the name of the class.method name.
Benefit:
    They allow us to reuse code.
Types Of method:
    1) method with void return type
    2) Methods with specific return types like String int double etc.

Task
Create a method which will take an array of ints as
input and going to return the sum of all the numbers
from the input array

Methods in general

How do we know when we should create a static variable:
    Whenever we want to store something that is universals(Constants) and
    it does usually change we can safely go and create a static variable for
    that. Like value of PI value of Gravity  Value of E.
How do we know when we create static methods?
    When our methods don't require instance fields create them as static.
