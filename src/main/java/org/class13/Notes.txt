Methods in Java:
    Methods/Function/Behaviours are blocks
    of code. They contain statement(lines of code) which
    are executed when a method is called.
    A method in java has a return type(output) name and parameters/arguments(inputs).

Why should we use methods?
    Methods help us reuse the code. When we need to share/reuse a
    piece of code within our project or with others we can
    create our own classes define methods inside those classes
    and we can start reusing/sharing them.

Syntax of the method:
    returnType(output) nameOfTheMethod (input/parameters){


    }
