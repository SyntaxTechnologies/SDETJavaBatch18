What is Type Casting:
    Type casting is changing the datatype of data.
    data types from small to large.
    byte
    short
    int
    long
    float
    double.
    There are two types of type casting.
    Automatic/widening/implicit
        when we move from smaller boxes to large boxes it is
        called automatic/widening/implicit.
    Manual/Narrowing/explicit:
        When we move from a larger box to a smaller box.
Why we need type casting?
    1) Sometimes we might only be interested in whole numbers
    and want to ignore the decimal parts.
    2) When multiple developers work on the same project
    they might use different data types, and
    we might have to convert
    these before we merge their code.
 What is the syntax:
    No syntax when we move from smaller to larger box simply assign
    the values and conversion will happen.
    When we move from larger to smaller box we need to use () inside them,
    we specify destination data type.
    double box1=12.3;
    int box2= (int)box1;
Relational Operators:
    Relational operators help us compare things. They return the answer
    in the form of a boolean true or false.
    > greater than
    < less than
    == equal to
    != not equal to
    >= greater than or equal to
    <= less than or equal to
Example
    10>5  true
    5>7  false
    5<10 true
    12<10 false
    13==11 false
    15!=15 false
    10!=12 true
    1>=2 false or false -> false
    2>=2  true or false -> true
    10<=10 true or false -> true
    5<=8  true or false true
