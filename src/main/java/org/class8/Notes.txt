Arrays:
    It's a collection of similar items. The data is
    stored in consecutive memory locations inside the
    memory. We use indexing to store and access the
    data in an array. Every element that we store in
    an array is assigned a number these numbers start
    from 0 first element will be assigned number 0 then
    next one 1 and so on.
Why we should use arrays:
    It's not feasible to use variables for large
    amounts of data.
    Storing managing searching large amounts of data
    becomes easier with arrays and loops.
Syntax of Arrays:
    We can create arrays in two ways
    1) DataType[] nameOfArray= {item1,item2,item3};
    String[] names={"Kawoon","Patrick","Halil"}
    2) DataType[] nameOfArray=new Datatype[Size];
    int[] numbers=new int[5];
